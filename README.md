# Password Strength Checker

## Overview
This Python application is a **Password Strength Checker** built using the `Tkinter` library for a graphical user interface (GUI). It evaluates password strength, provides real-time feedback, and allows users to generate strong passwords. It also offers the functionality to export feedback to a file for future reference.

## Key Features
- **Password Strength Evaluation**:
  - Analyzes the password based on length, character diversity, and patterns.
  - Scores the password strength as `Weak`, `Moderate`, `Strong`, or `Very Strong`.
- **Real-time Feedback**:
  - Provides actionable suggestions to improve password security.
- **Password Generator**:
  - Generates strong random passwords that meet security standards.
- **Customizable Options**:
  - Users can set a minimum password length requirement.
- **Toggle Password Visibility**:
  - View or mask the entered password.
- **Feedback Export**:
  - Save feedback and the entered password to a text file.

## How It Works
1. **Enter a Password**:
   - Input a password in the GUI. The app will immediately evaluate its strength and display feedback.
2. **Generate a Password**:
   - Use the "Generate Strong Password" button to create a secure password automatically.
3. **Export Feedback**:
   - Save the password and suggestions to a text file for future use.

## Code Explanation
- **Password Assessment**:
  - Uses regular expressions to check for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and avoid repetitive or common patterns.
- **Password Generator**:
  - Creates a random password with letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Real-Time Feedback**:
  - Displays password improvement suggestions in a listbox as users type.
- **GUI Implementation**:
  - Built with `Tkinter`, including widgets like entry fields, buttons, checkboxes, and progress bars for a user-friendly experience.
